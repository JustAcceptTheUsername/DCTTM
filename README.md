Dogecoin to the moon game for intership

This is the game I was tasked with making for the intership.
The point of the game is for the rocket with the dogecoin inside to get to the moon.
To do that you must fly and collect fuel and coins. Fuel replenishes your current fuel, while coins are used for upgrades in the shop.
